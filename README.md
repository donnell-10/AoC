# Ace of Checkers (AoC)
Ace of Checkers was originally my A-level computer science project. However, I never completed it, so this is my attempt to finish it, improve it, and optimize it. The premise of this game is to create a checkers game and add a story mode to it. So while ordinary checkers can be played on it, the goal is to incorporate it into a story. One where there are different characters and each one has a different way of affecting the game of checkers. It could be pretty cool.

## Usage
Currently, the only functional game modes are the 'vs CPU' game mode and the 'snake minigame'.
Run the vs_cpu.py file to play against the computer.
Run the Snake_minigame.py file to play the minigame.
